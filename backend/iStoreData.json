Outplayed and desperate, and with no legal recourse, the three would-be entrepreneurs hatch a misguided plan to kidnap the investor's adult son and ransom him to regain control of their company in this follow-up to the 2011 hit comedy \"Horrible Bosses\" that reunites stars Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as everyone's favorite working stiffs. Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey also reprise their starring roles, while Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz star as new adversaries standing between the guys and their dreams of success.",
